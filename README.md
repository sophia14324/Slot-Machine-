# A Slot Machine Game

The Python code simulates a basic slot machine game and not the actual machines at casinos for they have different rules, symbols and other advanced features. 

## How the game works:

1. When the program is run, the user is prompted to enter a deposit amount. They are then given the option to spin the slot machine or quit the game.

2. During a spin, the user can choose how many lines they would like to bet on and the amount they want to bet on each line. 

3. The program then generates a random set of symbols for each line and determines if the user has won any money based on the combinations of symbols that appear.

5. The user's winnings or losses are then calculated and added to or subtracted from their balance. 

6. The game continues until the user decides to quit or runs out of money.
